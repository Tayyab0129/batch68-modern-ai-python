# Assignment : Grading Program
***Note:** Use the concepts learnt so far.*
**Description**:
Write a program to take the marks of 5 subjects as input from the user, and print a result card.
The result card should contain the following:
1. The date and name, fathername, roll number of the student
2. Total Marks, obtained marks and grades secured in each subject.
3. The total marks (all subjects), Marks Obtained and Grades secured overall (all subjects).
4. Make sure the handle edge cases. (e.g. if the user enters a string instead of a number, or a number greater than 100, etc.)
5. The program should be dynamic i.e. it should ask for the student's name, father's name, roll number, and marks of each subject and perform the desired operations based on the provided input.

**hint**:
1. use the input() function to take input from the user.
2. use if-else statements to handle edge cases.
3. use f-string to format the output of the program i.e. result card.
4. Subjects: Math, Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, English. Each subjects would have total marks of 100.
